## 🖥️ Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **PHP** | 7.4+ / 8.x |
| **MySQL** | 5.7+ / 8.0 / MariaDB 10.3+ |
| **Apache** | 2.4+ |
| **Browser** | Chrome, Firefox, Edge (modern) |

**Recommended:** [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) — bundles Apache + MySQL + PHP.

---

## ⚙️ Installation (XAMPP)

### Step 1 — Place Project Files

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\lms\        ← Windows
/opt/lampp/htdocs/lms/      ← Linux
~/Applications/.../htdocs/lms/   ← macOS
```

### Step 2 — Start XAMPP Services

Open **XAMPP Control Panel** and start:
- ✅ **Apache**
- ✅ **MySQL**

### Step 3 — Create the Database

1. Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Click **New** → name it `student_management_system` → **Create**
3. Select the new database → click **Import**
4. Choose `lms/database.sql` → click **Go**

### Step 4 — Configure (if needed)

Edit `config.php` — defaults work with standard XAMPP:

```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'root';
$db_pass = '';           // XAMPP default: empty
$db_name = 'student_management_system';
```

### Step 5 — Fix Upload Permissions

**Windows:** Right-click `lms/uploads/` → Properties → Security → give Write permission.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod -R 775 lms/uploads/
```

### Step 6 — Launch

```
http://localhost/lms
```

## 🔑 Default Login Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Admin** | admin@lms.com | admin |

> 💡 More sample accounts are seeded by `database.sql`.
